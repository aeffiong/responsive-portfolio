            <p>Hi, my name is Atim Effiong, and I am a Utah native who loves fitness and my
            dog Butters. I have always had an interest in building things but wasn't sure 
            in what capacity. I have found that coding has a been a great outlet for me to create.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I grew up in Ogden and a attended a small school where I played soccer, basketball,
            and ran track. To this day, I still have 2 state records for track. One in the 100m dash
            and another one in the 4x100m relay race. I attended the University of Utah and received a 
            Bachelor's in Exercise and Sport Science with minors in both Nutrition, and Human Development.
            I then attended the University of Arizona where I received a Master's in Public Health. I moved
            back to Utah after completely my degree in 2013. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Since then I have been a study coordinar where 
            I data analysis for large research study database, started an online business personal training,
            and currently work in the employee wellness sector. My vision is to combine health and fitness or healtcare
            with web and app development to provide a better user experience for clients, patients, and data collection.
